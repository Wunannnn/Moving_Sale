        <b>HONDA CRV Auto RD7 2006 4 Door SUV Compact 4WD PETROL 2.4 litre,<br>
        K24A1 I4 16v DOHC VTEC MPFI {118kW}<br></b>
        227300km

        Rego until 8/5/2023
        <br>
        This 2006 Honda CR-V ABS brakes, 16" alloy wheels, air conditioning, driver airbag and drivers footrest.
        <br>
        I've had this car more then 4 years.<br> After purchasing the car, I had my car serviced every 6 months.<br>
        The most recent inspection was in September of this year, and it was thoroughly inspected. 
        <br>Receipt can be provided.
        <br><br>
        The engine check light started 2 years ago.<br> According to the mechanic, it was a problem with the fuel pressure sensor.
        <br>
        I was going to replace the fuel gauge when it broke, but it still works great to this day.
        <br>
        The light is sometimes it disappears and sometimes it appears.
        <br>
        Depends on how the car feels.<br>
        Car drives beautifully and mechanically the car is brilliant. 
        <br><br>
        Last year the car's underbody brake system was replaced with a new one.<br>
        Front and rear stabilizer, Front and lower Arms with bushes,Rear and Front disc rotors and break pads, break oil, intake hose, Front sway bar bush...something more. it was around $2100.<br>
        and changed new front tires this year Feb.<br><br>
        This car has a <u>tasmaina license plate</u>. But it's easy to renew.<br>
        Or, you can replace your car's license plate with a another state.<br>
        That's why i lowered the price to take that into account.
        <br>
        <br>
        Price is slightly negotiable.
