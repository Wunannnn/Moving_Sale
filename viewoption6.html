      A single blue line appears on the screen as shown in the picture.<br />
      This is a bad display. Exchange results from contacting HP is possible,
      but it will take time. It does not affect performance, and there is no
      discomfort when viewing the screen.<br />
      At the time of purchase, the laptop was in need immediately, so I did not
      exchange it.<br />
      Fortunately, the warranty is guaranteed until March 2023.
